Pydantic AI libraries for easy agentic orchestration

## Problems / friction

* Hard to containerize agents 
  * They sometimes need docker
  * They sometimes need an actual browser for testing
  * Privileged containers give too much access 
* Track where each branch / project is in the prompt/dev process
* Reuse prompts easily
* Support multiple agents with a unified interface
